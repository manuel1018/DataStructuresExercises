# Data structures and algorithms 
## A few examples focus on data structures and algorithms with Java
### Merge Sort

An efficient algorithm for sorting, the main advantage of this technique is its approach to O(n) complexity when we work with a great amount of data.Since its average performance is O(nlog(n)),merge sort is not recomended for using with a small amount of data.

## Stacks
LIFO(last in-first out) structures.Stacks are dynamic structures which means once created it can stored unlimited data. Because of its behaviour,stacks are used for verifying if a string follows certain rules like: (a+b), if we apply an stack we'll know if the string is provided with both opened and closed parentheses.
